# IN1010 - Object-Oriented Programming in Java

Welcome to IN1010 - Object-Oriented Programming in Java! This course is a continuation of IN1000 - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and delves deeper into the world of object-oriented programming using Java as the primary programming language. In addition to Java, this course provides an introduction to the language. IN1010 also explores essential data structures and algorithms.

## Course Overview

In this course, you will embark on an exciting journey to expand your programming skills and knowledge. By the end of IN1010, you will have achieved the following learning outcomes:

### What You Will Learn

- **Proficiency in Java:** You will gain a solid understanding of the Java programming language and be able to use it effectively to solve real-world problems of moderate complexity.

- **Advanced Object-Oriented Concepts:** Master advanced object-oriented mechanisms such as subclasses, polymorphism, and interfaces, enabling you to design and implement complex software systems.

- **Data Structures:** Acquire knowledge of fundamental data structures, with a special focus on linked lists, and be able to program key operations on them.

- **Robust and Reliable Programming:** Develop the ability to create robust and reliable programs with well-structured object-oriented designs. You will learn to explore alternative solutions for a given problem and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches.

- **Parallel Programming with Threads:** Gain insights into parallel programming using threads and apply this knowledge to develop simple multi-threaded programs.

- **Event Handling:** Familiarize yourself with event handling techniques and write basic programs capable of managing events.
